# Merge Sort

Unique features of merge sort
* It is a stable sorting algorithm along with insertion sort.
* It grows on the order of theta(NlogN) which is by the far the best.

Downsides
* Straight forward approach required O(N) auxiliary space.
* Donald knuth did mention we can implement merge sort in place but increases the complexity of the code.

Additional Info
* Mergesort with insertion sort is a good idea.
* Mergesort can be optimized for efficient use of caches. Tiled mergesort.
* Mergesort is the best algorithm for sorting linkedlists.
* General implementations use timsort combination of mergesort and insertion sort.

# Divide and Conquer:
* Divide the problems into independent subproblems,conquer them as to solve them and them combine those subproblems.
* Use master theorem for calculating the time-complexity.
