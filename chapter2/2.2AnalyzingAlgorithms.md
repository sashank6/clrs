# Analyzing Algorithms


Every algorithm is evaluated based on the time it takes and the space it takes, aka time-complexity and space-complexity respectively. 

The evaluation of complexity is computed for three cases best,average and worst.

Best: The lower bound of the algorithm. That is minimum number of instructions executed. Eg: in linear search best is theta(1) as the element we are trying to search might be the first element.

Average: If we take inputs in normal distribution and give them to the algorithm, and divide the total complexity computed by number of inputs we get the average case. It is roughly close to worst case time complexity.

Worst: In this case we calculate the upper bound of the algorithm. That is the maximum number of instructions executed or the maximum space it can take. 

We do the above evaluations to answer the question "How slow the algorithm gets with larger input?" aka order of growth.
