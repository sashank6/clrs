# Bucket sort

## Info
* Bucket sort makes an assumption that the input is generated by random process following normal distribution.
* It has an average running time of O(n).

## Algorithm
* Form n equal spaced buckets for the numbers in normal distribution.
* Assign a bucket to a number and put it inside a bucket.
* Sort the bucket using insertion sort or any other stable sorting algorithm. 
* Take the sorted numbers from buckets starting from 0 or n according to the sort rule.
