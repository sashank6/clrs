# Binary Search Trees
1. Binary Search tree property. Left child should be <= root and right child should be >=root.
2. Tree Walks.
   * Inorder Tree walk or inorder tree traversal. Retrieves the elements in sorted order.
   * Preorder tree walk or traversal.
   * Postorder tree walk or traversal.
   * Level order tree walk or traversal.
   * The time complexity is theta(n) in worst case.
3. Tree terminology
   * Root node: The topmost node without a parent.
   * Height/depth: Number of levels in the tree.
   * Leaf nodes: The nodes which do not have children.
   * Sibling nodes: A group of nodes with same parent.
   * Degree: The number of subtrees or children of the node.
   * Child node, parent node.
