# Divide and Conquer

Three basic steps for solving a problem using divide and conquer.

1. Divide the problem into independent subproblems until they are solvable.
2. Solve the subproblems.
3. Combine the solutions of the subproblems.

## Recurrences
They go hand in hand for divide and conquer algorithms.

## Time complexity calculation
We can use three methods to calculate time complexity for divide and conquer
* **Substitution Method:** Guess a bound and use induction methods to compute time complexity.
* **Recursion-tree Method:** Convert the recurrence into tree by evaluating costs for each node and use bound simulation techniques for computation.
* **Master's Theorem:**: Represent the relation in form of T(n)=aT(n/b)+f(n)
