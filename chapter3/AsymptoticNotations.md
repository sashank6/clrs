# Asymptotic Notations

\theta(N)
* k1.f(x)<g(x)<k2.f(x) = \theta(g(x))
* Basically \theta notation is a tight bound between two constants k1 and k2.
* It is generally close to O notation.
* \theta and Big-Oh transformation.

Big-Oh
* To measure upper bound time-complexity.
* Generally used for worst case.

Big-Omega
* To measure the lower bound of the algorithm.
* It is the least used notation among all three.
